TODO:
- players who join later don't show up (skyblock)
- skin layers are borked
- statistics (blocks and such)
- mobs are SUPER buggy on and around slabs
- attacking in freecam

DONE:
- skins show up wrong
- killer is wrong when shot by bow
- mobs are too smart: actively avoid falling down (turned out to be ai overriding water movement)
- fall damage is seemingly reset by falling along the edge of a block

meh:
- lava still sometimes flows before water
